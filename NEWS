DESCRIPTION
-----------

The first GenoGAM package was a first step towards introducing generalized additive models (GAM) to the biological field.
The implementation was mostly done around the excellent mgcv package, which provides a very flexible GAM framework. The flexibility
however comes at a price of increased runtime and bigger overhead. With the new version of GenoGAM, mgcv was replaced by a
GAM framework specifically optimized for biological applications, significantly descreasing runtime and overhead.

NEW FEATURES IN VERSION 2.0
-----------------------------
	o Simplified underlying infrastructure due to replacement of the mgcv package at the core of GenoGAM
	by an inhouse build GAM model optimized for biolocial applications. This significantly reduces overhead
	and thus runtime and memory consumption.
	o GenoGAMDataSet can now be efficiently created from SummarizedExperiment objects
	o Access to the GenoGAMSettings class, to modify global settings for computation of the model
	o Included logging on different levels for easier maintanance and debugging
	o Included second penalization (first order) for regions with very low coverage.
	o Included extensive unittests for all functions
