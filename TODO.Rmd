# To implement

- Quality checks. Just like logging on different levels
- Logging has to be output to files if threshold is debug
- Plotting
- differential binding
- peak calling
- export function
- suppressWarnings does not work in tile construction if parallel backend is Snow
- optimize estimation of parameters (linesearch algorithm, see Nocedal algorithm 3.5 and 3.6, maybe C implementations might be of use in some parts)
- store only the original B matrix and move the creation of design matrix X by colData to init step
- make family class object, to keep all functions in there
- make exportable cross validation function
- make se computation more efficient, by using C code for looping over the matrices, as we only need the diagonal of the end result
- use C code in lbfgs (direction computation)?
- split unittests for estimation and genogam function
- make tilelength dependant on number of cores - 2 and 4gb per core
- make gaussian part of release version?
- combine bpknots in genogam() and in the creation step of GGD (bpknots in settings?)


# Till tuesday
- demonstrate that default tolerance in hessian inversion works
- length of tiles
- cross-validation (use same regions for given lambda/theta with different tile size; scatterplot fits)
