# To implement

- Quality checks. Just like logging on different levels
- Logging has to be output to files if threshold is debug
- Plotting
- differential binding
- peak calling
- export function
- suppressWarnings does not work in tile construction if parallel backend is Snow
- optimize estimation of parameters (linesearch algorithm, see Nocedal algorithm 3.5 and 3.6, maybe C implementations might be of use in some parts)
- family function to avoid 'if(family == nb)' and then specifying the respective functions
- store only the original B matrix and move the creation of design matrix X by colData to init step


- demonstrate that default tolerance in hessian inversion works
- length of tiles
- cross-validation (use same regions for given lambda/theta with different tile size; scatterplot fits)
