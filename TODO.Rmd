# To implement

- Quality checks. Just like logging on different levels
- Logging has to be output to files if threshold is debug
- Plotting
- differential binding
- peak calling
- export function
- initial construction of the design matrix takes too much memory for big chunks: Optimize the spline.design function (maybe copy and implement with sparse matrix)
- suppressWarnings does not work in tile construction if parallel backend is Snow
- check computaton of SEs, might be very memory intense
