# To explore

- Iterations for beta estimation are usually in the hundreds, sometimes even exceeding 1000 and taking up to 7 seconds. Look for better initialization of beta, beyond mean over the response vector.
- maxiter cap seems to effect fit (obvious) but also to gluing at junction point
- Quaility checks. Just like logging on different levels
